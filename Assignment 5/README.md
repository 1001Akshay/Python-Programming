Assignment 5

Task 1:
At first we have created the dictionary dict_stu to store the name of students as key and their marks as value.
To yake the input from the user we have declared a variable name using input function and store it.
Laterly we have used if else condition to check if the name of student is present in dictionary or not.
In print statement we have used .format statement to use the value of it.

Task 2:
Firstly we have declared a list l and printed it as "Original list".
From the list we have extracted it's first 5 elements from index 0 to 4 i.e.[0:5] as the 5 index is not extracted and then printed.
And then reversed the Extracted list by using reverse iteration [0:0:-1] i.e. the element is iterated in reverse direction and then printed the list.
